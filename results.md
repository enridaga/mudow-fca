## Definitions
What's the probability of a certain dimension to characterize a certain resource?
Observe [the bottom layers of the lattice](layers.md).

Selecting association rules with high support and confidence ([see rules.md](rules.md)), we derive the following definitions:
- A Repository is a collection of publicly accessible resources organized for human consumption, browsable.
- A Dataset is a collection published in an *interoperable format* for research purposes, which access is public and free of charge.
- A Digital Library is a browsable collection focused on *descriptive metadata*, delivered with public access for research purposes.
- Digital editions are *browsable scores* for human consumption, publicy accessible, free of charge, for research purposes, including descriptive metadata.
- A Catalogue is focused on browsable *descriptive metadata* exposed both for human consumption and in an *interoperable format*, publicy accessible, free of charge.


## Relevant associations
Some dimensions, without having a large spread, can still characterize relevant subsets.
We selected the best rule for each head (consequent) - highest support (with a trashold of 0.3 support).
